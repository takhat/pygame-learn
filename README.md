How I made this game:

SET UP:
(Create a new repo in your github and clone it to your local machine.)
Run the following commands in the Terminal:

1. Create a new virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install pygame: 
pip install pygame

4. List pygame as a dependency: 
pip freeze > requirements.txt
(This allows others to create a virtual environment and installing dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt)
